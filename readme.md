# Hi there, I'm Ugo or themushdev ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and AI strategist specializing in building robust conversational AI systems. My focus is on creating intelligent agents that are not only functional but also secure, efficient, and provide a great user experience. I have a particular interest in prompt engineering and AI security testing (jailbreaking).

My goal is to bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation, architecting AI solutions that deliver real-world value.

### ðŸš€ Current Project Spotlight: Donna Watson AI Agent (Private Repository)

I am currently architecting and developing **Donna Watson**, a state-of-the-art, AI-powered tutor for Business English. This project involves complex prompt engineering, n8n workflow automation, and a multi-layered security architecture to create a personalized and secure learning experience directly on WhatsApp.

-   **Core Technologies:** `n8n`, `OpenAI (GPT-4)`, `PostgreSQL`, `Git/GitHub`
-   **Current Status:** In structured testing phase

*Due to the proprietary nature of the prompt architecture, this repository is private.*
